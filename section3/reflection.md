## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
* This felt a little bit scary and I was nervous I was going to royally mess up but I did not and this was just another reminder that there is no need to panic!

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
* When you first open the Peloton app, it gives a list of workouts to choose from: Yoga, Meditation, Cycling, Strength etc. Then when you click on a specific category of workout, it opens to a new page and lists all the workouts available on-demand within that specific category. I believe Arrays are used in both instances within the app.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
* An Array method is a function within Javascript that can be used specifically on Arrays.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
* The purpose of a loop is to run a specific block of code a certain number of times. You only need to write the code one time. The loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
* You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if you wanted to perform the same action on each element in the array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
* Loops repeat an action again and again. In programming, loops are used to run the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is met. Loops are a fast way to repeat something.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
* When researching the Array methods, in some examples I saw `push` and `shift` were stored within a variable. I am curious to see how this works but I am guessing it is a way to save that value before removing it in case you need to reference it again within your code.
