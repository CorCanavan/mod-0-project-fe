# Array methods

1. `pop`
* The `pop()` method **removes** the *last* element from an array and returns that removed element. Since this method removes the last element from the array, it also changes the length of the array.

2. `push`
* The `push()` method **adds** one or more elements to the *end* of an array. This method then returns the new length of the array; this new length includes the element(s) added.

3. `shift`
* The `shift()` method **removes** the *first* element from an array and returns that removed value. Since this method removes the first element from an array, it also changes the length of the array.

4. `unshift`
* The `unshift()` method **adds** one or more elements to the *beginning* of an array. This method then returns the new length of the array; this new length includes the element(s) added.
