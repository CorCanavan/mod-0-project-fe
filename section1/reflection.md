## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I feel okay about asking questions, although my anxiety and self-doubt tend to sneak in and cause me to worry about how I might come across (like I don't know anything), but I know my anxiety will be worse if I don't ask the question in the first place! I am somewhere in between asking them too soon and waiting too long. I'm realizing with things like error messages my first reaction is a tummy flip that I did something horribly wrong, but I'm learning error messages are your friends and you learn from them. On the other end, I definitely spend too long overanalyzing sometimes. I like the suggestion of setting a timer for 30 minutes to figure something out and see if you are making progress before reaching out for help, and will definitely be utilizing that. I also appreciate the formula Turing provides for asking questions as a way to help structure my thoughts around the issue I'm running into.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* I learned about three primitive data types: Numbers, Strings, and BOOLEANS
* **Number** - this data type handles all numbers, including negative numbers and decimals. Ex: `-72`
* **String** - this data type is made up of any kind of text (letters, numbers, special characters) wrapped within either single or double quotes. Ex: `"This is a string."`
* **Boolean** - this data type returns either of two values: `true` or `false`

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
`// text after two forward slashes indicates a single line comment`
`/* text wrapped with a forward slash and an asterisk are for multi-line comments */`
The purpose of code comments is to explain what your code does in spoken language; this is helpful to both you and other developers looking at your code by making it easier to read and understand. Code comments are not processed by the Javascript interpreter.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* A variable stores the value of a data type that can be continuously referenced throughout a codebase. It is called a variable because the data it stores can be changed.
* A variable is a "box" for a value with a label describing what is inside.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
* Thinking of the Peloton app, three variables that are probably used are:
1. `lengthOfWorkout` would probably store a number
2. `typeOfWorkout` would probably store a string
3. `instructorName` would probably store a string

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* Concatenation combines two or more strings together using the plus sign `+`

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
* Thinking of the Bank of America app, I think developers use concatenation for the main screen when I first log in that says "Hello, Corinne."

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
* I am eager to see how booleans are used within programming as I am having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around the concept of this particular data type.
